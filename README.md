# Inception Tic Tac Toe

A dumb little game made for my AP Computer Science Principles Perfomance Task.

It's a 3x3 grid of squares, but each square is filled with its own 3x3 grid of Tic Tac Toe. Players take turns placing their mark anywhere on the grid. When a a player wins on a mini-grid, that entire square is filled with their mark. The first player to get 3 large squares in a line wins.
